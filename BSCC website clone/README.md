# BSCC Website Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a frontend clone of the Bihar Student Credit Card (BSCC) official website, created using only HTML and CSS.

The goal of this project was learning and practice, not to perfectly replicate the original website. It helped me understand how real-world websites are structured and how CSS can be used to design layouts similar to live platforms.
